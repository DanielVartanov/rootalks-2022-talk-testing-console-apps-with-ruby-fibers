-- Section: Console tools on the rise

(slide: Rust logo and Golang logo)

Hello! At first, a little tribute to Rust and Golang. Because of them
we are now having a renaissance of console tools development, a whole
new wave to replace long-standing pillars of built-in console tools,
which live with us for _decades_.

+------+--------+
| cd   | z      |
| grep | rg     |
| find | fd     |
| cat  | bat    |
| mc   | xplr   |
| ls   | exa    |
|      | fzf    |
+------+--------+
There are very good replacements for cd, grep, find, cat, midnight
commander and even something as simple as ls.

And even _new_ tools emerged, fuzzy search tool, fzf, written in Go,
it doesn't have a predecessor. There was no mainstream console tool for fuzzy
search at all!

But. Don't get me wrong: all those grep and find, they are great, it's
just the new ones are _even better_ for everyday use. For the first
time in decated people dared to challenge gem, and succeeded.
Again, thanks to the rise of low-level programming languages, which
are designed for systems programming.


-- Section: Console apps, not just console tools!

But here comes a problem, an unfortunate price of this success:
console programs still get associated with low-level programming, or
even systems programming. Inevitably, console programs are perceived
as something which is hard to write.
_It's a myth, and I am going to bust it now._ Just give me a few
minutes :-)

On purpose, I will call console programs console **apps**, not console
tools, exactly to emphasise they can solve daily users needs, or even
business needs.

And, also on purpose, I'll write them Ruby, an indisputably
easy-to-learn language. As a Ruby enthusiast, I would note that Ruby is
rather hard to master, but anyway it's a remarkably junior-friendly
language.

**But**, before I go further, a real-life example!

In my previous startup, very suddenly, our home-grown Continuous
Integration was broken, irrevocably. We decided to finally move away from
our home-grown Jenkins to Github Actions and CircleCI, but it would
take _weeks_ to move all the processes, checks, guard rails to new CI.

So, while we were waiting for the our CI, we needed something _quick_
to make our deployments a bit less error-prone, you know, to keep all
the safety measures. When you deploy manually, they are very easy to forget.

The best solution turned out to be console app, I'll quickly show it
to you now.


-- Section: Demo of my deployment app

// it checked whether someone else is deploying right now
// it checked if you have deployed your changes to staging before
    deploying production
// it allowed for fast track in emergencies

Demo script:
// spinner fetching data
// "No on-going deploys detected, you can procees"
// Your changes were not staged yet. What do you want to do?
   // 1) Deploy these changes to staging
   // 2) Deploy to production anyway (хоп-хоп и в продакшин) // можно
           даже цветом потемнее сделать или шрифтом поменьше, тогда
           можно и "хуяк" оставить
   // 3) Abort safely
// "It even allowed to pick specific commits do deploy"
// Checkboxes over pretty git log
// spinner, git push output
// Success banner


A nice looking app, does its job, easy to use. Above all:
I didn't have to write backend and frontend in web. HTML forms,
controllers, or even worse, frontend framework, storing github secrets
at server, authenticating the user. Non of that is needed as the app
is running locally, at a machine of each developer, there is no
server, everything is in the app, no backend and frontend, git credentials of each user is their
authentication, no need for security checks, no server running in
cloud, no monitoring, no maintenance, no nothing.

I estimate, overall building it as a console app took several times
less engineering time than building it as a web app.

And now you'll see how _easy_ such apps are built in Ruby.


-- Section: Building console apps in Ruby

(short demo of easiness of tty-toolkit things, awesome! Right in IRB,
show awesomeness! `TTY::Checkbox.new(options: system('git pretty-log').split("\n")))`

// spinner: inside could be, say, `git push`. Just imagine amount of
frontend work and backend work to have the same spinner in web.

// see script-drafts.rb


-- Section: Okay, we wrote an app, how do we test?

Imagine a web app, how do we test it?

From a bird's eye view functional testing of a web app looks like
this: you've got nested cases, when the account is created, when there
is item

```
context 'when I create an account' do
  before { post '/accounts', account_data }

  # ...

  context 'when I add an item to my account' do
    before { post "/acconts/#{account.id}/items", item_data }

    # ...

    context 'when I delete that item' do
      before { delete "/items/#{item.id}" }

      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

(tell about differences between web and console, the _points_ of rest
where you can test the app)
  "a meaningful point of rest your code _stops_ executing for some
  time so that you can inspect the surroundings or provide a new
  input, a new nudge to your code"
  In unit-tests these meaningful points of rest are the method call:
  before you call a method, and after.
  In web application world it is before and after a HTTP request, you
  provide an input as requerst data, after request you inspect a
  response, you might inspect your database or other surroundings. In
  short, those are meaningful points of rest.

```
context '' do
  ...
  context 'when on-going deploy is detected' do
  end

  context 'when no other concurrently running deploy deteced' do
  end
end
```

In Ruby world, you _expect_ things to be tested like this, _this_ is a
quality of life which is _default_ to us, Rubyists.

But if you _actually_ try to test your console app like this,
surprisingly you _won't_ find neither a testing library, nor a testing
framework, nor even a simple way of doing it, there is just no way.

After many experiments it turned out that probably the best DSL for
console apps testing framework you can get if you use Ruby Fibers.
Fibers were introduced one major Ruby version ago, but they are still
underappreciated, not widely used.



-- Section: How Fibers work in Ruby in general
   (how is it called in general, "manual scheduling" or what?)
   (maybe concurrency/parallelism, ad your talk "just google What does
   Gil guarantee you, you'll see my talk [and show a screenshot so
   that they knew they have found a right one!]")

TODO: find out how to call an execution/code thread, as the word
"thread" might indicate a context of automatic scheduler. In Fiber
world it has to be a more general term, no?

(In case of normal threads Ruby interpreter has full control over when
    execution of one thread switches to execution of another one...)
(Mainly it happens at method boundaries, but in general it's all
   concealed.)

(In Fibers its all the way around, you got 100% control. It doesn't
mean it's easier, or better, it's just different, pick it only for the
right task)

(
example:

```
3.2.1 > result = HTTP.get
_
```

Not a single line of your code gets executed until the server
responds, we are stuck. Fibers won't help here.

Now:

```
3.2.1 > result = HTTP.get_async
     => <Result::Waiter # ...>
3.2.1 > result.done?
     => false
3.2.1 > result.done?
     => false
3.2.1 > result.done?
     => true
3.2.1 > result.to_s
     => "{ message: 'Hello, world!' }"
```

So, in real life, something like this happens:
(behind the scenes:
`spinner = TTY::Spinner.new(format: :bouncing_ball)`
`spinner.singleton_class.define_method(:spin) { sleep(0.1); super() }`
(or insert `sleep(0.1)` into result.done?)
```
result = HTTP.get_async
loop
  spinner.spin
end until result.done?
```
(run this and show that spinner spins)

Now here we can do fibers:
```
http_fiber = Fiber.new do
  result = HTTP.get_async
  Fiber.yield
  loop
    spinner.spin
  end until result.done?
end
```

(and then show that spinner does **not** spin until we do
`fiber.resume`!, as the thread does not get executed it at all until
we explicitly say so)
then run `fiber.resume` for several times to show that spinner spins,
until we get the HTTP result

(behind the scenes HTTP can be just a `sleep(3); "{ message: "Hello, world!" }"`)

)

-- Section: So, how tty-testing is built internally, where fibers are
   // muahahaha, the shortest part of all talk! :-D


-- Demo of test code for the simplest deployment app
   when doing it, place the contexts in turns, each "slide" is a new
   context so that people could read


-- Section: Conclusion / The End
   (tty-testing wants to be in tty-toolbox one day)

  This testing framework is shipped as a gem called `tty-testing`, it
  is not officially included into `tty-toolkit` because I am too lazy
  to do the boilerplate work, but it's already usable! Enjoy! Thank
  you :-)



TODO
----

- They might ask about other console testing frameworks, so google
  around is e-cukes (or how was it called?) still around? Did
  something new appear?

- Демо-аппку (да и тесты, наверное?) запускай на абсолютно чёрном
  полотне, не в своём tmux'е полу-сером, ещё и со статус-баром, а
  воообще чтобы не было краёв, хммм, только надо сделать так чтобы не
  в углу экрана всё было, хммммммм. Может, и правда в емаксе?
  - Кстати, статус бар можно и нужно убрать `(setq mode-line-format
    nil)`, наверняка и messages mini-buffer можно убрать

- Process this:
```
(i) It's okay to finish earlier! "Well, I guess you got a few minutes
free now :-)"

(i) Speak sloooooowly

web applications have well define moments when they can be tested: before and after a request

but an application, it just runs, potentially forever if a user doesn't quit

just like with any other frontend (and yes, console **IS** a type of frontend, though quite peculiar one) those defined points in time are the user inputs and the application outputs
  ...and that's why we focus on _them_ (inputs and outputs) while testing console apps

tty-toolkit is an amazing set of tools, huge thanks to its maintainer
  this gem will become a part of the toolkit when there is enough application developers use it
     therefore, now it's over to you folks!

How to begin:
 go, rust, renaissance of new console tools development
 console apps devlopment is often associated with low-level
 programming, high-speed execution, where every byte, every CPU cycle
 counts. But that's not always the case, especially when the app is
 interactive, when most of the time it waits for the user to make a
 move.

 Even juniors who write in a simple language as Ruby can do it.

 (personal story time!) Once in my previous life, when I've been building a startup, we faced
 a problem... Continuous Integration software failed, over team was
 overly busy, long story short we had to maintain our deployment
 procedure manually, on our own.

 ... No server to monitor, no alerts to have, no server to maintain,
 no nothing.


`4) Deploy anyway (хуяк-хуяк и в продакшин)`, лол
